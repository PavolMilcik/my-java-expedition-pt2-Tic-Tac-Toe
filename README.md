A text-based console game - Tic Tac Toe = Noughts And Crosses - in Java.


## What game have I created? :technologist:
I created a text-based console game: **Tic-Tac-Toe**, 
<br>also known as **Noughts and Crosses** or **Xs and Os**, in Java.

Play the timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe with friends and family. 

This **Java-based** implementation allows you to challenge your friends 
<br>and test your wits against each other. 

Enjoy hours of fun and strategic thinking!

##

In this game, **two players** are involved.

- At the beginning of the game, they create a custom **game grid**.

- Then, they choose their player **symbols**. 

- After the duel ends, a **winner** is determined, or it may result in a **draw**.

- All **statistics** are displayed.

Essentially, the game can be played indefinitely.
